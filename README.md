# Lung-Cancer-Prediction
The effectiveness of the cancer prediction system helps people to know their cancer risk at a low cost and also helps them make the appropriate decision based on their cancer risk status.



Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant lung tumour characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in lung tissues. This growth can spread beyond the lung by metastasis into nearby tissue or other body parts.


In this project, we tried to predict Lung Cancer using six different algorithms:
1.	Logistic regression classification
2.	SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification
3.	Naive Bayes classification
4.	Decision tree classification
5.	Random forest classification
6.	K-Nearest Neighbor classification


Predictor variable use in classifying lung cancer:
1.	Age
2.	Smokes
3.	AreaQ
4.	Alcohol
